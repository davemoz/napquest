# [NapQuest](https://napquest.co)

There were times when my wife, and son, and I would have to be somewhere at a certain time, and we would leave early and take an unknown, out-of-way route to extend the drive so my son could nap in the car. This became cumbersome to pick side roads at random, or head in the opposite direction of our destination only to turn around too soon, or not soon enough.

I built NapQuest so we could plan a driving route based on duration, instead of optimized for shortest or quickest route like every other navigation app, so that our son could nap and we could still arrive at our destination when expected.
